closed permanently this winter, and was sold in May to a new owner. Unclear
whether the new owner will operate the orchards, store, or anything else. If
you know, please write me. Tree-Mendus Fruit Farm in Eau Claire, Michigan, closed Dec. 31.According to radio station WSJM in St. Joseph, Michigan, The
farm made the announcement on Facebook in late December, saying the entire
450-acre property is now going on the market.The farm has been in the Teichman family for three generations, but it suffered
some big losses in 2019, starting with the death of Herb Teichman to start 2019,
followed by the polar vortex which took a heavy toll on fruit trees throughout
the region. This past summer, third-generation farm owner Bill Teichman fell ill with
Eastern Equine Encephalitis from a mosquito bite, and he's still recovering from
the disease that killed two-thirds of the people afflicted in the state this
year .Tree-Mendus Fruit closed for good on Dec. 31, 2019. The farm gained notoriety
nationwide for hosting the International Cherry Pit Spitting Championships every
Fourth of July since 1974.The farm is known in the area for its U-Pick and well beyond for its famous,
long-running International Cherry Pit-Spitting Competition.To read more and find out about the farm and the GoFundMe page to help support

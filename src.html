<p>Looking for a local, pick-your-own farm in Southwest Michigan?&nbsp;Scroll down this page and you will see the U-Pick farms in Southwest Michigan,
sorted by county. Those that offer organic or sustainably grown produce are identified by the words "organic" and/or "sustainable" in Green, next to their name&nbsp;
(see &quot;<a href="../organicdefinitions.php" target="_top">What does Organic mean?</a>&quot;).
The U-pick crops they offer follow the name of the farm. To search the page for
a specific crop, use Ctrl-F (or on an ipad or Mac, use their &quot;search on this
page&quot; function) If they have a website, the name will be in blue and underlined;
click on it and it will open their website. If you find anything outdated or
inaccurate, see the customer and farmer menus (as appropriate) at the top menu bar to submit updates and corrections and help me keep each current!</p>
<p><span class="highlight">New!</span> As inflation remains high, see this page for <a href="../how-to-get-best-prices-for-canning.php">cost-saving measures for
getting fruit and vegetables and home canning</a>.<br>&nbsp;If you are having a hard time
<a href="https://amzn.to/2YQIGWj" target="_blank">finding canning lids, I've used these, and they're a great price &amp; ship in 2 days</a>. </p>
<p><span class="highlight">New!</span> Road tripping and camping is a great way to have a fun, safe and inexpensive
family trip. The national and state parks and monuments are open, and campgrounds usually cost between $10 and $40 per night. September to November is the best
camping weather.&nbsp; See our new website <a target="_blank" href="https://roadtrippingandcamping.com/" target="_blank">Road Tripping and Camping.com</a> for tips, tricks,
guides, checklists and info about parks, monuments and other places to visit. </p>
<p><span class="highlight"><b>New</b>!</span> We just went live with our latest website, <a href="https://funfactorytours.com/MI.php" target="_blank">
FunFactoryTours.com</a> - As they name implies, you can find a fun factory tour, including chocolate, automobiles, historical forts and sites, famous buildings,
Active Federal facilities even fun geology: like fossils and volcanic areas</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Beware the copycat websites like the one that stole
our name and uses .farm extension: they copied my work and do NOT even update
the info! I make updates EVERY day. They use tech tricks to get higher rankings,
but have many more inaccuracies and out-dated info. Obviously, I cannot check
every farm every day, but I do check as many as I can every day, and respond to
all requests.&nbsp; They don't. Don't support the scammers! </p>
<p>
<b>Remember to always check with the farm's own website or Facebook
page before you go - or call or email them if they don't have a website or
Facebook page. Conditions at the farms and crops can change literally
overnight, so if you want to avoid a wasted trip out there - check with
the farm directly before you go!</b>

July 02, 2011:</b> &quot;We spent the day at Overhiser Orchards picking cherries.
The orchards are large and beautiful, the fruit is delicious and the staff
is very friendly and knowledgable( they even stayed late on a Saturday
evening so we could keep picking.) It is also the least expensive orchard
we've encountered so far. Great experience, we will definitely be going back
for peaches and plums. &quot;</li>

Roundup to prevent weeds around the plants, and that he uses conventional

"Went blueberry picking at Rambo farms this year; we usually go to another
place, but decided to switch it up. The blueberry bushes were some of the
best we've seen and we've picked in a couple of different states. We are a
family of seven and everyone was happy! We also picked up some of the
blueberry syrup, and loved it."<br><b>A visitor writes on July 29, 2013:</b>
"We found the Rambo farm on your wonderful website. We have a new summer
home in Michigan and fruit picking is one of the things we couldn't wait to
try. I picked Rambo farm because it was very close, and easy to find. The
people were great, the blueberries were plentiful and the kids and 3 grand
kids loved it! We would have stayed longer, but it started to rain! We made
pies today, using your fabulous and easy recipe. Made one with graham
cracker crust and one with pie crust. The kids all helped and we have
priceless pictures! What a wonderful memory this will be! Thanks for putting
all this together, we will be back!"<br><b>Comments from a visitor on July 16, 2010:</b>
&quot;We have been picking blueberries for years in Michigan. I found this farm
this year from this website. It is by far the best crop of blueberries.
Price is fair, and their is plenty to pick from. Its worth it to go to

<br><b>Comments from a visitor on September 22,
2008:</b> &quot;We loved it. It was a nice farm they have someone to pick you up,
so you don't have to carry your apples. The apple trees are close so if you
want to walk you can. The atmosphere was so nice. they were so friendly and
accommodating. We go apple picking every year, this was my first time at
Springhope, ( I found them online) it was very good experience. I will be
going back, we really had a good time picking apples. They have some of the
best tasting apples I ever had and we eat alot of apples. &quot; </li>

some big losses in 2019, starting with the death of Herb Teichman to start 2019,
followed by the polar vortex which took a heavy toll on fruit trees throughout
the region. This past summer, third-generation farm owner Bill Teichman fell ill with
Eastern Equine Encephalitis from a mosquito bite, and he's still recovering from
the disease that killed two-thirds of the people afflicted in the state this
year .Tree-Mendus Fruit closed for good on Dec. 31, 2019. The farm gained notoriety

mushrooms, heirloom and specialty vegetables, apples, blueberries, Montmorency cherries, and apple cider on our 25 bushel cider mill.Our fruit, vegetables,
and mushrooms are all grown using natural methods and the farm is now Certified Organic through the USDA and MOFA. We are passionate about growing great
food in a way that is sustainable and healthy for our farm, ourselves, and our community. Our cider is made in the traditional way on a press that has been
in use for over 100 years. We offer an increasingly rare view of our history with the apple in Michigan, using fruit that is grown without the use of
synthetic materials and a press that is still cranked by hand. We are proud to be a part of the time-honored tradition of cider-makers in Michigan and
strive to carry that torch by continuing to make a simply delicious product, free of preservatives or chemicals. </li>
